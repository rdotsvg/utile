<p>scrobli is a super simple css template for your website.<br>it has a very minimalist apple notes feel to it :D</a></p>
<p>it's just a template, so you can do whatever you want with it, whenever, however. because it's also open source under the <div class="tltp">mit license<span class="tltpt">essentially a license that lets you do anything with the software</span></div>!</p>
<p>you'll need to change some variables in the code before you deploy, but otherwise it'll be smooth sailing from download.</p>
